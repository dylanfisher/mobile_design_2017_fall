- Students share their work.

### Homework

- Choose a destination for Window to a World.
- Visit it and document it using a field note approach: photos, videos, notes, descriptions.
- Think about what draws you to this place, why you want to create a project around it, how you feel when youâ€™re there, the purpose of the space, the current design of the space, how a user enters and exits the space.
- Include a map of the space with key moments inside of it.
- Things to start thinking about: how technology can add to the environment? to the narrative? How do you want to name your location?
- Research any existing apps and branding for your space only after you've visited the environment.
- Put all of your research into a PDF presentation that can be accessed at the start of class. (a few pages of fieldnotes with imagery and descriptions, a map of the place, why you're interested in the location, what feelings you have there, what you want to focus on, how technology can add to it)
- Reading: [Grids by Rosalind Krauss](assets/readings/krauss.pdf). Come to class with one question/comment about the reading.
