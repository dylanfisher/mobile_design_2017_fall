### In Class
- Review App Store Activities
- Share your project outline with a partner ask yourselves these questions: 1. Is the flow of the presentation logical? 2. What deliverables would help bring the project to life? 3. What would help someone unfamiliar with the project understand it better? 4. Visually, is the project cohesive? Where can it be improved? 5. Does the app itself seem realistic? Would a programmer have enough information to program it?
- Class work day

### Homework

- Finalize your outline and continue making progress on each check point
- Continue working on your brand guidelines and final presentation (including video or websites)
