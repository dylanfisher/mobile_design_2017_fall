- Review [Responsive Web patterns](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/patterns.html)
- Using Sketch* sketch out 3 different responsive layouts for your text. Do a desktop and mobile sketch for each layout. Think about how the reading experience can between each layout, and consider what might improve the reading flow in each section.
- Limit yourself to using web safe fonts: Arial, Times New Roman, Courier, Verdana, Georgia. While you should always be thinking about your type choices, the goal of this exercise is to think about responsive layouts.
